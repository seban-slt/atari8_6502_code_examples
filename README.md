This repository contain several code examples for 8-bit Atari systems (Atari XE/XL series). The code is written in 6502 assembly language.

The purpose of this repository is to share the code that I created for my friends and colleagues. They asked me how to do certain things, and I want to show them what some things can be achieved on 8-bit Atari machines, and that the coding for 8-bit Atari systems is not so hard.

The next idea is to share this simple pieces of code to the world. Maybe somebody will find something interesting here, or maybe someone can learn something. Fell free to share, spread and modify. All code shared was written by Me, and from now this will be Public Domain.

I'm using a [XASM](https://github.com/pfusik/xasm) cross assembler and [SciTe](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html) editor with "xasm.properties" included to XASM. So, please use XASM to compile all this examples. Some examples can be probably compiled with [MADS](http://mads.atari8.info) cross assmebler also, but not all examples MADS can compile.
