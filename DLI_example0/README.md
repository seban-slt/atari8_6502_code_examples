This piece of code show how to use DLI interrupts in text modes, to change the colour of text and how the principles of the raster-bars works. This example is created after creating the example based on graphics modes, this code is shorter than previous and easier to understand.


TO DO:

- [x] ~~change the addresses of registers to their names (sorry, but I remember the addresses of each hardware register directly, so I don't bother to remember their names)~~ mostly done by @skrzyp, needs review from @seban-slt.
