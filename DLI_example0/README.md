This piece of code show how to use DLI interrupts in te- [x]t modes, to change the colour of te- [x]t and how the principles of the raster-bars works. This e- [x]ample is created after creating the e- [x]ample based on graphics modes, this code is shorter than previous and easier to understand.


TO DO:

- [x] ~~change the addresses of registers to their names (sorry, but I remember the addresses of each hardware register directly, so I don't bother to remember their names)~~ mostly done by @skrzyp, needs review from @seban-slt.
