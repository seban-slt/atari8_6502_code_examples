This repository contain several code examples for 8-bit Atari systems (Atari XE/XL series). The code is written in 6502 assembler.

The purpose of this repository is to share an code created for my collogues as examples to show them that the coding for 8-bit Atari systems is not hard. Maybe somebody will find something interesting, or maybe someone can learn something.

Fell free to share, spread and modify. All code shared here is public domain.
